# NL22 (NerdLang 22)

## Intro

NerdLang is a programming language aimed to be easy to learn and efficient. Although it is programmed in Python, an interpreted and notoriously slow programming language, the language is going to be compiled to Assembly and ran from there. 

__NerdLang is currently in development stage and is not yet a turing-complete language. Currently, it can only be ran on Linux.__
